I wanted to animate an svg design and incorporate element of randomness
in the selection of images, use css animation to tilt it left and right
and give more information on the designer brand.and give more information on the designer brand.

This is my final project for Drawing on the Web and I enjoyed making it. I am satisfied with the final outcome as it is aesthetically pleasing, and incorporates many techniques we have gone through in class.

I used CSS animation, JS, external CSS file, HTML file, images from the designs of my sister.
